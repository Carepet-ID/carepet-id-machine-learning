## Introduction

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`) for training machine learning models. The notebooks include data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and visualization of results. The aim is to provide a comprehensive guide for understanding and implementing machine learning models.

## Features

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Model building and training in Jupyter Notebooks
- Model evaluation and metrics calculation
- Saving and loading trained models
- Visualization of training progress and results

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow/PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter
- **Environment Management**: Anaconda/Virtualenv
- **Configuration**: YAML

## Datasets

The datasets used in this project should be placed in the `data/raw` directory. The `data_preprocessing.ipynb` notebook handles the cleaning and transformation of the raw data into a format suitable for training.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python (>= 3.8)
- Jupyter Notebook
- pip


## Training and Evaluation

The training and evaluation notebooks will save model checkpoints and final models in the `models` directory. Logs and results will be stored for further analysis.
